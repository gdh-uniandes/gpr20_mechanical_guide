\section{Introduction}
The GPR-20 robot aims to collect data from remote areas in Colombia, where Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) are usually placed. In order to fulfill its task, the robot must have a strong and robust mechanical structure that is able to support and move the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) over the survey area. The mechanical structure of the robot must posses features that make it able to overcome non-leveled terrain and reduce vibrations from movement. This document, the mechanical structure guide, presents the mechanical structure of the GPR-20 robot, detailing its major and minor components and elements. 

The mechanical structure is based on the idea of a Cartesian coordinate robot i.e. a robot that moves linearly along its different degrees of freedom. The linear part of the robot will be used to move the GPR over two axes (X and Y) to allow acquiring data from a survey area. The linear Cartesian coordinate robot is complemented with the capability of rotating over the Z axis, to provide the GPR with dual polarization measurements. Finally, the mechanical structure must include a case in which power and electronics systems are stored.

Most of the mechanical structure was manufactured using a standard Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing process. Elements that could not be 3D-printed, were acquired from third-party vendors. Those elements consist of linear rods, PVC tubing and mechanical couplers that, to the best of our knowledge, can be easily acquired worldwide. Because of the 3D-printing and the easily-acquired elements, we consider that the mechanical structure of the robot can be easily replicated. 

GPR-20 mechanical structure can be divided into four major groups: ground support group, Cartesian arm support group, GPR support group and electronics box group. The ground support group allows the robot to work firmly on an irregular surface. The Cartesian arm support group are the elements that hold the elements required for the Cartesian arm to work. The GPR support group holds both the vector network analyzer (VNA) and the antennae that probes the ground. Finally, the electronics box group keeps the electronics and power components safely from the environment.

This document is divided into three major sections: an overview of the mechanical structure presented in section \ref{sec:overview}, a discussion on the manufacture processes and its cost on section \ref{sec:manufacture}, and detailed information on each of the components that comprise the mechanical structure on section \ref{sec:components}.

\newpage
\section{Overview} \label{sec:overview}
The GPR-20 robot is presented in figure \ref{fig:robot}, in which the mechanical structure of the robot can be identified. The mechanical structure is divided into four major groups: ground support group, Cartesian arm support group, GPR support group and electronics box group. The ground support groups consists of elements that raise the robot to allow the movement of the GPR above the ground while keeping it leveled and stable. The Cartesian arm robot are the group of elements that allow the GPR support group to move within the sample area. The GPR support group keeps the VNA and the antennae steady. Finally, the electronics box keeps the electronic and power components safe from the environment.

    \caption{GPR-20 robot render, in which the mechanical structure can be identified.}
    \label{fig:robot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ground_support} shows the ground support group. This group consist of a unique ground support element that is replicated four times. The group of support elements distribute the weight of the robot in the ground and provide leveling capabilities for the rest of the robot. Each ground support element has eighth (8) minor components, which consist of four custom parts and four third-party components. The most relevant third-party component of the ground support element is the PVC tubing since it determines the overall height of the robot. The length of the PVC tubing can be changed depending on the antennae selection and the measurement conditions.

    \caption{GPR-20 ground support group.}
    \label{fig:ground_support}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cartesian_arm} presents the Cartesian arm support group. The Cartesian arm provides the linear movement of the robot over two degrees of freedom. The movement of the Cartesian arm allows the GPR to acquire data from the survey area. The maximum movement over both axes is approximately 700 millimeters per axis. The Cartesian arm moves using three NEMA 23 motors: two for the X axis and one for the Y axis. The rotational movement of the motors is converted to a linear movement using a lead screw. Two parallel rods are used next to the lead screw to provide stability.

    \caption{GPR-20 Cartesian arm group.}
    \label{fig:cartesian_arm}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:gpr_support} presents the GPR support group. The GPR support group are the components that hold both the Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and the antennae. The GPR support group includes two NEMA 17 motors that rotate the antennae. The antennae rotation is used to gather data in two polarizations. The GPR support group is elongated to provide enough room for the electronics box to get below the VNA thus increasing the survey area.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:electronics_box} presents the electronics box group. The electronics box keeps the power and electronic components safe from the environment. The electronics box also includes a support for a touch screen, which is used to input the user commands. The electronics box aims to have the systems organized within the robot and to allow for changes without major mechanical modifications.

The robot was designed using \href{https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview}{Autodesk Inventor} with files stored in four repositories. Autodesk Inventor was used because it allows a professional development environment. The repositories includes both the design and ready-to-use files. The reader will find the description and instructions in the repositories. Links to the repositories are presented in table \ref{tab:mechanical_structure_repos}. The repositories include the STL files, which are used to generate the G-Code for 3D printing the parts, and IPT files that are used to modify the parts in Inventor. Assemblies of the groups are also included in the repositories.

\section{Manufacture and Costs} \label{sec:manufacture}
This section presents and overview of the manufacture process and the cost calculation for each custom part used in the GPR-20. The manufacture process is performed using FDM 3D printing. The device used for the 3D printing is an Anycubic Chiron printer. The slicer software used for the process is \href{https://ultimaker.com/en/software/ultimaker-cura}{Cura} from Ultimaker. Table \ref{tab:3d_printing_setup} presents the setup used in the slicer software for 3D printing the custom parts.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
        Layer Height & 0.2 mm \\
        Wall Thickness & 1.2 mm \\
        Top/Bottom Thickness & 1.2 mm \\
        Infill Density & 10\% \\
        Infill Pattern & Cubic \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Slicer software setup for the 3D printing process.}
    \label{tab:3d_printing_setup}
\end{table}

Cost calculation can be calculated with two variables: amount of material ($m$) used for the part and print time ($t$). Equation (\ref{eq:part_cost}) presents the formula used for cost calculation for each custom part of the GPR-20 robot. This equation takes into account three parameters: material cost ($c_{m}$), energy cost ($c_{e}$) and power consumption for the 3D printer ($P_p$).

\begin{equation}
    C(m, t; c_{m}, c_{e}) = m \cdot c_m + t \cdot P_p \cdot c_e
    \label{eq:part_cost}
\end{equation}

The total cost of manufacturing a custom part for the GPR-20 robot will be in the units of United States Dollars. Material amount ($m$) is expected to be in units of grams and print time ($t$) in hours. Material cost parameter ($c_m$) is expected to be in units of dollars per gram, energy cost ($c_e$) in dollars per kilowatt-hour and power consumption ($P_p$) in kilowatts.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \textbf{Specification} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
        Material Amount & 1375 grams \\
        Print Time & 57.15 hours \\
        Material Cost & 0.022 USD/g \\
        Energy Cost & 0.178 USD/kWh \\
        Power Consumption & 0.6kW \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example specification for calculating the cost of a custom manufactured part.}
    \label{tab:cost_example}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:cost_example} presents a set of specification for calculating the cost of an example part. This part would require 1375 grams of material and a printing time of 57.15 hours. The commercial value for a reel of 1000 grams of PLA filament is 22 USD and the example energy cost is 0.178 USD/kWh. Finally, the used 3D printer consumes 0.6kWh during its operation. By computing the cost using equation (\ref{eq:part_cost}) it is possible to estimate that this part would cost 36.35 USD.

STL files for the robot part are found in the four repositories of the GPR-20 mechanical structure. STL files are a \textit{de facto} standard for 3D models. These files are used in Cura to generate the G-Code required for the 3D printing process. No G-Code files are shared since they depend on specific setup values for the 3D printer and the filament.

\newpage
\section{Components} \label{sec:components}
This section presents detailed information on the major groups of the GPR-20 robot mechanical structure. The major groups that will be presented are the ground support, the Cartesian arm support, the ground penetrating radar (GPR) and the electronics box. Each group is presented as a whole and then a set of subsections in which the custom components are presented. Besides from presenting the technical details, costs are also presented to give a sense on the value for the whole mechanical structure.

\subsection{Ground Support}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/ground.png}
    \caption{Ground support element.}
    \label{fig:ground_support_element}
\end{figure}

The ground support group are the set of elements that provide support to the mechanical structure. Its main function is to provide a solid and robust contact with the soil. The ground support group also provides leveling capabilities to the structure in order to improve the data acquisition quality. Figure \ref{fig:ground_support_element} presents a single ground support element. The ground support group consists of four replications of the ground support element. Table \ref{tab:ground_support} presents the cost summary for a single ground support element.

\end{table}

A ground support element is made from four custom parts manufactured using PLA and the FDM 3D printing process. Third-party parts include a two-inches PVC tube and some metric screws with their corresponding inserts. A M7 screw is used to provide the leveling capabilities of the ground support element. The rotation of the M7 screw changes the height of the ground support element, thus adjusting for the terrain elevation changes. Height changes from the M7 screw depend on the latter length. However, it is recommended to allow for a maximum of $30$ millimeters height adjustment. The following subsections will introduce the custom parts used in a single element with the last subsection devoted to third-party components.

\subsubsection{Ground Support: Third-Party Components}
Third-party components used for a ground support elements are a two-inch PVC pipe, a set of screws, brass inserts and nuts. Table \ref{tab:ground_third_party} presents a summary of the required components to build a ground support element. M2 screws and inserts are used to merge components 1 and 2: inserts are introduced into component 1 and screws hold component 2 in place. M3 screws and inserts are used to join components 1 and 3: inserts are introduced into component 1 and screws hold component 3 in place. 

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Quantity} \\ \hline
        M2 Screws & 4 \\
        M3 Screws & 4 \\
        M7 Screws & 1 \\
        M7 Nuts & 2 \\
        PVC Tubing & 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Summary of the third party components used in the ground support group of the GPR-20 robot.}
    \label{tab:ground_third_party}
\end{table}

The M7 screw presented in table \ref{tab:ground_third_party} is the aforementioned leveling screw. The screw is held in place using two nuts. The first M7 nut is used in the component 0 to secure the screw in place, while the second nut is secured on the component 1 by the component 2. The second nut is the one that converts the rotation of the leveling screw into linear movement. 

Finally, the PVC tubing is merged into the custom parts by the component 3. The length of the PVC tubing in the ground support element will determine the height of the antennae to the ground. Thus the PVC length must be determined depending on the survey requirements. It is important to remark that PVC length must be equal for each ground support element.

\subsection{Cartesian Arm Support}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/groups/cartesian_arm.png}
    \caption{Cartesian arm group.}
    \label{fig:cartesian_arm_group}
\end{figure}

The Cartesian arm group (shown on figure \ref{fig:cartesian_arm_group}) are the set of components that perform the mechanical movement of the linear axis in the GPR-20 robot. The Cartesian arm group is able to move the GPR support group using three NEMA 23 motors. The rotational movement from the motors is converted to a transnational movement by a linear screw. To improve the stability on both axes, two linear rods are located parallel to linear screws. The group itself consists of eight (8) custom components. Table \ref{tab:cartesian_arm} presents the custom components list and the estimated cost of manufacturing.
